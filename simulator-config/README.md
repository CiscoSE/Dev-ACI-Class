# Simulator Configuration for ACI Automation Sessions

## Overview
This folder contains a series of scripts used to demonstrate Day One Configuration of ACI. This portion is presented as part of the demo, but is not intended to be part of the hands on experience. Scripts in this area may also be used to configure Student System configurations. 

## Architecture
Each student environment consists of a dedicated ACI simulator with two leaf switches and one spine. All sessions are predominantly GUI based with the majority of changes made by Ansible or Terraform, and then viewed / validated through the GUI.
